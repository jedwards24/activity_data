Process files & git or ignore:

News file?
Reports on previous years
Write Rmd on basic data structure (pre and post-processing)
Add checks on bike parts processing
Review bike part processing

For rolling, I could have a single tsibble with an "All" type in addition to other types.
Have a function `add_type_total()` which add this (option to have any other combinations of type
and different all_type level name).
Then add all MAs to the data for each metric.
Filter at plotting stage (plotting function? types, min_date, max_date)
