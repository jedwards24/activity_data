Write Rmd on basic data structure (pre and post-processing)

Power "frontier"" plots (see hill climbs project)
- general function to do scatter plot with max y for given x <= x_i in different colour
- Return table too?

## Bike part processing

Use bike lookup CSV?

Runtime tests:
[x] Any replace/new/front/rear should have a part name
[x] Missing values (except part)
[x] Each category/part should have one of new/replace/front/rear
- more?
