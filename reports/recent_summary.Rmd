A summary of activities for `r length(week_starts)` weeks from `r start_date` to `r end_date` (inclusive).

I did `r nrow(dt)` activities.

```{r}
count(dt, type) %>% 
  my_kable()
```

# Hours by Week

```{r hours1}
tot_hrs %>% 
  bind_rows(all_hrs) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, hours, group = type, col = type)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +

```

```{r hours2}
tot_hrs %>% 
  mutate(type = factor(type, c("F", "B", "R"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, hours, group = type, fill = type)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Hours", title = "Activity Time by Type")
```

```{r hours3}
tot_hrs %>% 
  mutate(type = factor(type, c("F", "B", "R"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, hours, group = type, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Hours", title = "Activity Time by Type")
```

```{r hours4, include = FALSE}

  ggplot(aes(week, hours)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_label(aes(label = round(hours, 1))) +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Hours", title = "Total Activity Time")
```

# Distance and Ascent

```{r distance}
week_totals %>% 
  filter(type %in% c("F", "R"),
         metric == "distance") %>% 
  mutate(type = factor(type, c("F", "R"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, value, group = type, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Distance (km)", title = "Foot Distance")
```

```{r ascent}
week_totals %>% 
  filter(metric == "ascent") %>% 
  mutate(type = factor(type, c("F", "B", "R"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, value, group = type, fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Ascent (m)", title = "Ascent by Type")
```

# Training Load

These show 2023 only, up to `r max(totals$date)`.


```{r tl1}
plot_tl(totals, hours, 2023, types = "frb") + ggtitle("All Activities")
plot_tl(totals, hours, 2023, types = "r") + ggtitle("Running Only")

plot_tl(totals, ascent, 2023, types = "frb")
plot_tl(totals, aer, 2023, types = "frb")
```

# Main Activities

Longest 2 activities in the last 6 weeks for each activity type.

```{r dt_most}
dt_most <- dt %>% 
  mutate(weeks_since = isoweek(end_date) - isoweek(date)) %>%
  filter(weeks_since <=5) %>% 
  mutate(weeks_since = isoweek(end_date) - isoweek(date)) %>% 
  select(-week) %>% 
  group_by(weeks_since)
```

```{r long_bike}
dt_most %>% 
  filter(type == "B") %>% 
  slice_max(time, n = 2) %>% 
  my_kable(caption = "Longest bike rides")
```

```{r long_foot}

```

```{r long_run}
